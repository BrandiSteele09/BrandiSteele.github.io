<h2 style="text-align:center;">RALSEI [HE/THEY/IT]</h2>

<p>Ralsei is a friendly guy who just wants to do his best. He actively looks for ways to make his friends happy, and it always seems to hurt him to see his friends upset.
Beside this, he works hard to keep himself up, happy, and mentally well the best he can. However, internally, he struggles with a lot of self-hatred and doubt that anyone
actually like him. This doesn't keep him entirely down though! He's learned to live life to the absolute fullest, and is determined to keep this opinion active and make the
most out of the time he has. <br/>
<br/>
Even with his flaws, they're still a loveable and approachable guy that just wants to make others happy, and will do whatever it takes to make that happen. He is smart, but
a little dumb at times. It makes up for that by how cute it is! </p>

<div class="Reenaprofile" style="position:relative; left:555px; overflow:auto;">

  <img src="images/ReenaHeadshot.png" 
  width="348px"
  height="280px"
  border="5px solid"
  alt="Reena! A teal wolf/shark hybrid (manokit) with purple eyes." 
  style="float: right; margin: 15px;"/>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">REENA [SHE/THEY/IT/XE/BEE]</h2>

<p>Reena, unlike Ralsei, has a few more concerns and problems with life than he does. She's a lot more cautious, but does take the time to make sure she has a fun and interesting life.
She enjoys spending time with her friends, making plans whenever she isn't working or busy with special events or holidays. They dream about taking care of children with their girlfriend 
one day, but doesn't see it happening anytime soon. She is plus-sized and off-color, which causes her a lot of discrimination from other species and customers at her job, but it doesn't
let the words get to her. <br/>
<br/>
Despite being cautious, motherly, and caring, she lives peacefully with Ralsei as a roommate and they have fun. Reena cooks and makes plans for the both of them, while Ralsei tends to clean
and buy things like groceries, accessories, and other essentials for their living space.</p>

<div class="Indigoprofile" style="overflow:auto;">

  <img src="images/IndigoHeadshot.png" 
  width="348px"
  height="280px"
  border="5px solid"
  alt="Indigo! A tall and big, grey, purple, and blue-scaled koilagon with blue eyes." 
  style="float: left; margin: 15px;"/>
  
<h2 style="text-align:center;">INDIGO [SHE/THEY/IT]</h2>

<p>Indigo is a quiet yet caring soul, willing to help out anyone. Sisters and close friends with Reena, Indigo often comes over to her and Ralsei's apartment to accompany them and 
do small household chores when they can't such as cleaning or cooking. While her mobility and skills are limited, she's never against learning something new or finding a way around
things she struggles with. Things haven't been the best for her mentally, emotionally, nor physically. She faces a lot of discrimination as koilagons aren't very welcomed in many 
spaces because they are predators to a lot of breeds. Her physical body is also very restricting, which causes her a lot of distress.<br/>
<br/>
Indigo is trying her hardest to live life easily, and so far it's proven successful! She is making immense progress and it really shows when she's at her highest emotionally. </p>

<div class="Grapefruitprofile" style="position:relative; left:555px; overflow:auto;">

  <img src="images/GrapefruitHeadshot.png" 
  width="348px"
  height="280px"
  border="5px solid"
  alt="Grapefruit! A dusty rose, purple taupe, and dusky purple cat with orange eyes." 
  style="float: right; margin: 15px;"/>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">GRAPEFRUIT [HE/THEY]</h2>

<p>Grapefruit, while not related to Indigo, Ralsei, or Reena, still is a really close friend to all three of them. He is one of the first friends they go to so they can make plans to
hang out. A cool-tempered and generally intelligent guy, he runs his own business that deals with with fostering puppies, kittens, and other little animals. He's rather good at his job,
and considers having his own children one day. He's hesitant, though, because despite being experienced he isn't really big on raising kids by himself and would rather wait until he found
a partner. Despite this, he is really sweet and likes looking after things for people.<br/>
<br/>
Grapefruit wishes he knew what more to do with himself, because outside of hanging out with the others and work, he doesn't really do much otherwise. He'll figure out what he wants to do
soon enough.</p>
