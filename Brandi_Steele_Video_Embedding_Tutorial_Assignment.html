<h1>HOW TO EMBED VIDEOS IN HTML</h1>

<p>Hello! Today, I'm going to be showing you <br/>
how to embed a video in HTML coding.</p>

<p>The first thing you want to do is find the video <br/>
you'd like to use. Once you have that, you can get started!.</p>

<br>
<p>The very first step to embedding a video is implementing the video or iframe tag as seen below. <br/>
This time, we will be using the iframe tag since we are using a video from YouTube.</p>
<img class="contentcenter" src="images/screenshots/Screenshot1.png"/>

<p>Then, you want to find your video source, or otherwise add your video to the element. this is done <br/>
with "src". The source would be the link to the YouTube video.</p>
<img class="contentcenter" src="images/screenshots/Screenshot2.png"/>

<p>Next, you want to set the video dimensions. You can either set these as a custom size, or look for <br/>
the size of the video itself. The size of the video works best, you can find this by looking at the <br/>
"embed" feature within the "share" button.</p>
<img class="contentcenter" src="images/screenshots/Screenshot3.png"/>
<img class="contentcenter" src="images/screenshots/Screenshot4.png"/>
<img class="contentcenter" src="images/screenshots/Screenshot5.png"/>

<p>Finally, add the title to the HTML and you're done! You now have a video embedded onto your website.</p>
<img class="contentcenter" src="images/screenshots/Screenshot6.png"/>

<p>If you want the white box around the video, you can leave it. However, if you don't want the white box, <br/>
you can set the "frameborder" to 0 as seen below. </p>
<img class="contentcenter" src="images/screenshots/Screenshot7.png"/>

<iframe class="contentcenter" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJS0zHLIXQY?si=Eq1rF638hbkP3XFx" width="560" height="315" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0">
</iframe>

<p>With YouTube videos, you can also copy the direct embed for the video within the share button (as seen above.) <br/>
You can copy this and directly paste it within your HTML. It results in the same product (below.)</p>

<iframe class="contentcenter" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJS0zHLIXQY?si=Keh4td5If2SI6WO9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  </body>
