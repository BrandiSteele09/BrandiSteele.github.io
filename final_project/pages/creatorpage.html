    <p>So, who is the creator of this website. Well, it's me! My name is Tommy Steele and I am 14 years old. I created this website as a Final Project for my Basic Web Design class. :)</p>
    <p>I am quite proud of it because it really tested my patience and my skills, and I believe it worked out in the end! I couldn't ask for a better website even if it's quite basic, but I'm extremely proud of it.</p>
