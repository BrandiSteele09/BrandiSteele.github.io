      <li>How were guitars created?</li>
      <li>How do guitars work?</li>
      <li>What are the parts of a guitar?</li>

    <p>So, the ultimate question. What is a guitar?</p>
    <p>Well, a guitar is a musical instrument that takes time to learn, much like any other instrument. There are many parts to a guitar. These parts include:</p>

    <ul>

      <li class="head">The headstock and tuner pegs</li>
      <li class="neck">The neck and fingerboards</li>
      <p>(These parts are the upper half of the guitar!)</p>
      <li class="body">The body</li>
      <li class="strings">>The strings</li> 
        <ul> 
          <li>These are what makes the sounds!</li>
            <ul>
              <li>(They are plucked, which cause them to vibrate and create pretty sounds!)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      <p>(These parts are the lower half of the guitar!)</p>

    </ul>
