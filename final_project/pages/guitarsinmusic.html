      <p>While the history of guitars go back years and years, the most agreeable and well-known "ancestors" of guitars date way back to Ancient Egypt, Sumerian, and Babylonian times. These people carried instruments like harps and lyres, which are far ancestors of guitars. Around 2500-200 BC were when more advanced technology was created.  <br/>
      The first sort of "guitar" that we can recognize today was around 200 BC-Renaissance era. These guitar were smaller, but consisted anywhere from 4-5 strings rather than the 6+ strings we know. These guitars also only had 8 frets. <br/>
      Finally, in the 17th-18th century the 6 strings were introduced to the guitar, and there were now a lot more frets than originally put on the instrument. </p>
