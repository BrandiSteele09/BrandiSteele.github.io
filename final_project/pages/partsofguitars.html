    <p>There are many, MANY different parts of guitars, and all of them together create a beautiful instrument!</p>
    
    <p>Starting off as the top of the guitar, we have the headstock and the tuners/pegs!</p>
    
    <img class="headstocks" src="/final_project/images/guitarheadstocks.jpg" alt="It is an image of many different silhouettes of types of guitar headstocks.">
    <img class="tuners" src="/final_project/images/guitarpegs.jpg" alt="An image of a woman tuning her guitar. There is a tuner attached to the pegboard, and she is turning one of the pegs.">
    
    <p>This is how the guitar is tuned. You turn the pegs up or down and they make the strings tighter (sharper) or looser (flat).</p>
    <p>Then, We have the neck, the frets, and the strings. These are where you play notes and where the guitar makes sound.<br/></p>
    
    <img class="neck" src="/final_project/images/guitarneck.jpeg" alt="An image of the neck of a guitar. It has frets and the headstock, but is stringless.">
    <img class="fretsandstrings" src="/final_project/images/guitarfretsstrings.png" alt="An image of a man with his fingers holding down the strings of a guitar against the neck.">
    
    <p>Finally, we have the body of the guitar. These can have many different shapes and sizes, much like the headstock. This, alongside the strings, is what vibrates and making sound.</p>
    
    <img class="bodyacoustic" src="/final_project/images/bodyacoustic.jpg" alt="The body of an acoustic guitar. It is round with a shape like the number 8 and has a large hole in the middle.">
    <img class="bodyelectric" src="/final_project/images/bodyelectric.jpg" alt="Bodies of many electric guitars. They range from round to spikey, and are all many different colors consisting of reds, blues, yellows, oranges, etc.">
