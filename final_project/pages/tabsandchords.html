    <p>Besides the basic anatomy of the guitar, Tablature and Chords are important, too. Tablature is the name of a certain language or way to read what strings you're supposed to play, as well as finger placements and other factors.</P>
    <p>In order to start learning how to read tabs, you need to understand each string. Tabs go from the top (the thinnest string, or the 6th string) to the bottom (the thickest string, or the 1st string). You can remember them simply using: 
    <br/>
    Eddie (E: thickest string) Ate (A: Second-Thickest string) Dynamite (D: Third-Thickest string), Good (G: Third-Thinnest string)-Bye (B: Second-Thinnest string) eddie (e: Thinnest string).</p>
    
    <br/>
    <p>The numbers on each line refer to the fret your finger is supposed to be on. For example, using the tabs for
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg" alt="The music video for Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana">Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana</a> below, you can see that there is 3's on D and A, and there are 1's on E. This means you put fingers on the third fret of the D and A strings, and a finger on the first fret of the E string.
    </p>

    <p>You can also see that there are X's on the strings. These X's just mean that the string is muted, or you put your finger on them lightly enough that they dont make sound. The opposite of this are 0's on the strings, which means you just play the base string without any fingers on any frets. If there are not numbers shown on strings, that means they are not played or strummed.</p>

    <p>Chords are quite different than tabs, being vertical and a completely different format. These show where and what fingers are supposed to press on the strings, and are focused on letters rather than numbers. For example, chords for the same song require the E, A, G, and C chords. X's and 0's mean the exact same things that Tabs do.</p>
